# proof_of_accuracy_consensus_Protocol
An implementation is presented as a proof of concept of a novel proposal of the proof of accuracy protocol. It seeks to democratize the participation of miners in a Blockchain and therefore control the computing power of miners and thus mitigate majority attacks in Blockchain systems.

All algorithms presented in the protocol definition were coded in Python. To simulate the behavior of the protocol in a peer-to-peer network, the implementation of a decentralized peer-to-peer network was presented by Maurice Snoeren at https://github.com/macsnoeren/python-p2p-network is used. The protocol code is adjusted, and some framework classes are modified for the correct implementation of the protocol and its peer-to-peer simulation.
